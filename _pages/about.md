Welcome to my personal website. I am a psychiatrist, an epidemiologist, and an AI practitioner. My primary research focus is on untangling the fundamental challenges in psychiatry. By delving into multi-modal healthcare data, I strive to improve precision in psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. This pursuit unifies psychiatric domain knowledge, causal inference, and AI methodologies, crafting a multidimensional approach to psychiatric innovation.

My research is fueled by a profound interest in the human mind, its consciousness, and the capabilities of artificial neurons and their networks. I regard deep neural networks as fascinating systems that interpret the world in ways that can be both analogous to, and yet distinctly different from, human cognition. The diverse perspectives they offer, some of which are qualitatively challenging to derive from human observations and cognitive faculties, have the potential to bring a multitude of fresh insights into the nature of our world.

This website is a platform for sharing my work, my insights, and for igniting meaningful conversations in these realms. Through these materials, I hope to provide not only a glimpse into my research but also to share with you a unique perspectiveâ€”where psychiatry, epidemiology, and artificial intelligence converge. It is my aspiration that you find the journey as fascinating as I do. Enjoy your visit.
