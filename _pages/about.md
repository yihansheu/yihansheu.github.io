Evidence-based medicine, over many past decades, has relied heavily on averages — treating patients based on means derived from clinical trials and observational studies. Despite our familiarity with this convention, it is severely limited, as it overlooks the unique challenges and uncertainties each individual faces in managing their health, often leading to suboptimal decisions and failing to anticipate and prevent issues that could be effectively addressed by fully considering individual differences.

My research aims to catalyze a paradigm shift towards fully personalized medical practice, where treatments are optimized for every individual patient at every moment, maximizing both life longevity and quality. To achieve this, an intermediary goal is to develop AI models that predict individual clinical outcomes and differential treatment responses with unprecedented precision and timeliness. My approach integrates AI, causal inference, and medical expertise to enhance predictive accuracy by identifying complex patterns in patient data. Conversely, these predictions are used to further scientific understanding by uncovering new relationships between patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. 

A special focus of my research and interest is mental health, where this personalized approach could transform our understanding and treatment of complex psychological conditions; and the broader and fundamental experiences and issues of being human.
